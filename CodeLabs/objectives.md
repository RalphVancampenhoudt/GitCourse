 ## After the course
 
 - I can see the bigger picture of git and have a basic knowledge of the fundamental git concepts.
     - I understand why I use version control (with git).
     - I understand the following concepts and am able to explain them:
         - Staging area.
         - History (Commits).
         - Local repository.
         - Remote repository.
         - States of a file (Tracked, untracked, modified,....).
         - Difference between the commands `init` and `clone`.
 - I can version my local code using git.
    - I can turn my codebase into a versioned codebase.
        - Using `git init`.
    - I can create a history for every modification made to a file.
        - Using `git add`.
        - Using `git commit`.
    - I can consult the history of modifications
        - Using `git log`.
    - I can create a remote backup of my versioned codebase (on GitHub).
        - Using `git remote add`.
        - Using `git push`.
    - I can download changes made on my remote versioned codebase and integrate them into my local versioned codebase.
        - Using `git pull`
        - *Using the change and commit functionality of GitHub.*
- I can download a remote versioned codebase using git.
    - Using `git clone`.

    - Using the fork functionality of GitHub.
    
## During the group projects
- I can work on a remote versioned codebase together with a team.
    - I can integrate my peers' modifications and additions into my own local versioned codebase.
        - Using `git pull`.
        - Using `git checkout`.
        - Using `git merge`.
        - I can solve conflicts related to integrating changes.
            - Using `git merge`.
            - Using IntelliJ to resolve the conflict.
    - I can create additions and modifications in total isolation, without affecting the main code.
        - Using `git branch`.
        - Using `git checkout`.
